# Growth Mindset

My idea of a growth mindset is being one hundred percent invested in one way of thinking or seeing challenges. Let's start by understanding a growth mindset; well for starters, people who have a growth mindset believe even when thongs are falling apart or they are struggling with certain things, they still have the ability to get the job done. Those that have a growthh mindset are very goal driven and see the bright side of things. I believe that you will thrive more by thinking in this way versus having a fixedmindset.
