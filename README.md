# Growth Mindset

My idea of a growth mindset is being one hundred percent invested in one way of thinking or seeing challenges. Let's start by understanding a growth mindset; well for starters, people who have a growth mindset believe even when thongs are falling apart or they are struggling with certain things, they still have the ability to get the job done. Those that have a growth mindset are very goal driven and see the bright side of things. 

I believe that you will thrive more by thinking in this way versus having a fixedmindset. Being able to believe that your abilities can improve with hardwork is the biggest key to success. Here are a few examples of a growth mindest:
- Beliveing everything is possible.
- Having an attitude of gratitude.
- Embracing challenges and feedback.
- Learning from critiques.

##Reflection and Discussion
Basic writing and formatting matter to me because, it helps to learn how to write or create a useful and complete code. With the instructions given I was able to add different formats to my website. This material was effective in multiple ways and thought me so much.
After reviewing the required readings and viewing the github video, here are a few study notes!
Fill in the blank:
- 1. You use blank to create a heading.
- 2. You can create a blank by wrapping link text in brackets, and then wrapping the URL in parentheses.
- 3. - or * are used to create blank.

If you answered #, link and list, then you are correct! The material given gave insite on how to add those basic writing formats while coding. 

## Things I want to know more about.
Some things I would like to learn include, how to properly add bolding to one specific word in a sentence versus the entire sentence. I would I also like to know, how to use a differnt coding software outside of github.
